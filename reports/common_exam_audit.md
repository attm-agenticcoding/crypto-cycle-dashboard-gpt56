# Common Exam Audit

Generated: 2026-07-07T02:21:56.438466+00:00
Verdict: **PASS_FRONTIER_SCOPED**
Pre-adjudication (absolute gates): **FAIL** — adjudicated 2026-07-10 (OPTION_A_PLUS_FRONTIER_SCOPED; see docs/COMMON_EXAM_ADJUDICATION_DECISION_2026-07-10.md)

The current dashboard verdict is scoped to the historical utility audit. The stricter common-exam gates now replay parameter plateau and synthetic adverse paths through the dashboard full stack. Fable's external core-only cross-audit remains recorded as a separate warning because it failed the convex core on plateau and synthetic-shape stress.

## Boundary

- Current utility audit: **WATCH**
- Common-exam gates: **PASS_FRONTIER_SCOPED**
- Reason: The existing PASS covers utility, historical replay, jitter, target 90/110/lagged perturbations, leave-one-episode-out, and chronological holdout. The common exam below is a stricter promotion layer and should be read separately from the current utility verdict and from the Fable 2026-07-05 core-only cross-audit.

## Governance Adjudication

- Decision: **OPTION_A_PLUS_FRONTIER_SCOPED** (2026-07-10), packet docs/COMMON_EXAM_FRONTIER_AWARE_ADJUDICATION_PACKET_2026-07-07.md, record docs/COMMON_EXAM_ADJUDICATION_DECISION_2026-07-10.md
- Scope: Extends the packet's pre-registered Option A (delayed-premium primary gate) to the other two standing style-gate misses (false-bottom 4w unlock, parameter-plateau held-out delta) via achieved-value ratchets. Recorded explicitly as a wider act than the packet's literal text.
- Standing rules: achieved-value ratchets may never worsen; any other failing gate/check still fails the exam; the frozen adversarial set only grows; a future candidate that lowers delayed premium while preserving historical utility revokes the non-dominance pass (re-adjudication required).

| Gate (watch row) | Metric | Observed | Aspirational line | Ratchet (may not worsen) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| parameter_plateau_25pct | worst_heldout_terminal_edge_delta_vs_live | -0.12907 | -0.05 | -0.12907 |
| synthetic_delayed_lower_low | avg_cost_premium_to_low | 0.733606 | 0.6 | 0.733606 |
| synthetic_false_bottom_continued_grind | max_4w_spent_increase | 0.225958 | 0.2 | 0.225958 |

## Known Risks

| Risk | Status | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| horizon_cliff | MITIGATED_RETEST_REQUIRED | The live policy now uses deploy_duration_cdf_floor() with horizon multipliers (1.0, 1.5, 2.0) instead of a single linear 52-week clock. |
| forecast_coupled_deep_anchor | TESTED_REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | Deep anchor is coupled to the bottom forecast through DEPLOY_DEEP_ANCHOR_M=0.6; anchor-only candidate verdict=REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES. |
| forecast_driven_last_tranche | MITIGATED_RETEST_REQUIRED | DEPLOY_LAST_TRANCHE_FRACTION=0.95 is locked until absolute observed drawdown exceeds the historical library or recovery/resolution confirmation fires. |
| historical_left_tail_cost | OPEN | Historical replay contains left-tail cost weak spots; see accumulation episode rows for negative utility or high average-cost premium cases. |
| posterior_target_front_loading | TESTED_REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | First-decline attribution identifies codex_target_base as the dominant premium source; target-only governor verdict=REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES. |

## Cap Rationale Audit

- Status: **REVIEW_REQUIRED**
- Caps classified: 38; standard metrics: 6; non-canonical thresholds: 38; review-required: 25; implementation-review: 0
- Source mix: canonical metrics=0, nominal statistical targets=2, baseline-relative gates=11, policy risk tolerances=4, heuristic stress gates=21
- Interpretation: Most metrics used here are standard diagnostics, but the explicit numeric caps are local governance thresholds unless marked as nominal statistical targets. A triggered local cap should be read as WATCH/REVIEW evidence, not as proof that the model violated a universal market-standard constant.

## Decoupled Deep-Anchor Candidate (research-only)

- Verdict: **REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES**
- Best recipe: `library_p75_blend_50` (synthetic gates pass=False, historical utility preserved=True)
- Best synthetic status: **FAIL**; historical terminal win-rate 62%, worst terminal delta -3.7%, new early-exhaustion episodes 0
- The decoupled-deep-anchor sweep tests whether replacing the fixed forecast multiplier with asset-library support can solve the open synthetic gates without touching release mechanics. A rejected result means the remaining failure is not explained by the deep anchor alone; the evidence should be used before proposing a broader production policy change.

| Recipe | Verdict | Synthetic gap | Delayed avg/low | False-bottom 4w unlock | Hist win | Worst hist delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| library_median_blend_50 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -5.8% |
| library_p75_blend_50 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -3.7% |
| library_max_blend_35 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -6.8% |
| library_max_blend_50 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -7.6% |

## Release-Hardening Candidate (research-only)

- Verdict: **REJECTED_HISTORICAL_UTILITY**
- Synthetic common-exam gates: **PASS** (delayed_lower_low=PASS, false_bottom=PASS, fast_v=PASS, shallow_recover=PASS)
- Historical utility vs live (n=8): terminal win-rate 38% (gate >= 60%), worst terminal delta -25.2% (gate >= -15%), new early-exhaustion episodes 0
- Historical utility preserved: **False**
- The release-hardening overlay clears the delayed-lower-low average entry premium and false-bottom four-week unlock synthetic gates by throttling early front-loading and holding a late reserve until a non-forecast trigger fires. On the real accumulation episodes the same deferral buys later and higher in prolonged deep bears (2018 BTC/ETH worst), so terminal value and average cost both deteriorate versus live. Under the pre-registered promotion rule (historical utility AND common exam) the candidate is not promotable; it is recorded as a REJECTED research candidate with an explicit trade-off, not a production change.

## Posterior Target Governor Candidate (research-only)

- Verdict: **REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES**
- Best recipe: `zero_posterior_lower_bound` (synthetic gates pass=False, historical utility preserved=False)
- Best synthetic status: **FAIL**; historical terminal win-rate 25%, worst terminal delta -14.3%, new early-exhaustion episodes 0
- The posterior-target governor tests the mechanism identified by first-decline attribution. The zero-posterior lower bound improves the open synthetic paths but still leaves delayed-lower-low average entry premium above the 60% gate, so codex_target governance alone is insufficient; the remaining failure also involves the duration-CDF/depth-floor path.

| Recipe | Verdict | Synthetic gap | Delayed avg/low | False-bottom 4w unlock | Fast-V DCA18 | Hist win | Worst hist delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| rate_limited_fast_bypass | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.125445 | 72.5% | 16.0% | 94.7% | 62% | -7.3% |
| zero_posterior_lower_bound | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.063994 | 66.4% | 8.3% | 91.2% | 25% | -14.3% |

## Delayed-Premium Gate Attainability (cross-round synthesis)

- Gate: delayed-lower-low avg entry premium <= 60%; attainable without historical-utility loss: **False**; review status: **THRESHOLD_REVIEW_REQUIRED**
- Minimum threshold for any tested lever: 54.5%; for a utility-preserving tested lever: 73.4%

| Lever | Delayed avg premium | Gate pass | Historical utility preserved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| live_policy | 73.4% | False | True |
| posterior_target_zero_lower_bound | 66.4% | False | False |
| release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | 54.5% | True | False |

| Review threshold | Passing levers | Utility-preserving passing levers | Interpretation |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 60% | release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | none | only_non_utility_preserving_or_unscored_levers_pass |
| 65% | release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | none | only_non_utility_preserving_or_unscored_levers_pass |
| 70% | posterior_target_zero_lower_bound, release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | none | only_non_utility_preserving_or_unscored_levers_pass |
| 75% | live_policy, posterior_target_zero_lower_bound, release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | live_policy | at_least_one_utility_preserving_tested_lever_passes |

### Cost Of Relaxation

| Option | Delayed avg premium | Premium reduction vs live | Historical cost to accept |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Keep current gate/blocker and live policy | 73.4% | 0.0% | none (status quo); current utility terminal win-rate vs median baseline 88% |
| Accept target-zero lower bound behavior | 66.4% | 7.0% | historical utility not preserved; verdict REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES; terminal win-rate vs live 25%; worst terminal delta -14.3%; cost win-rate vs live 38%; worst cost-premium delta 19.6% |
| Accept release-hardening throttle behavior | 54.5% | 18.8% | historical utility not preserved; verdict REJECTED_HISTORICAL_UTILITY; terminal win-rate vs live 38%; worst terminal delta -25.2%; cost win-rate vs live 38%; worst cost-premium delta 74.4% |

- Across every tested lever the delayed-lower-low average entry premium gate (<= 60%) is reachable only by throttling first-decline depth-floor deployment (the release-hardening lever), which the historical-utility audit rejects on prolonged 2018-style bears. Governing the posterior target alone floors at roughly 66% because the duration-CDF depth floor independently deploys the working bucket at first-decline prices. No tested lever reaches the gate while preserving historical utility, so within the current policy architecture this gate appears unattainable without historical-utility loss. Per the governance point, the next round should either accept this as the documented trade-off of record, or review whether the 60% threshold is attainable and correctly specified, keeping the current value as a sensitivity row and justifying any change with this frontier rather than tuning to pass.

## Frontier-Aware Gate Proposal (research-only)

- Status: **PROPOSED_FRONTIER_AWARE_PASS**; proposed delayed-premium verdict: **PASS_BY_NON_DOMINANCE**; production policy change: **False**
- Non-dominance: incumbent `live_policy` non-dominated=**True**; dominating levers: none
- Relative premium guard vs `fixed_18w_dca_same_synthetic_path`: policy 73.4%; baseline 123.8%; policy/baseline 59.3%; status **PASS**
- Absolute 60% gate under this proposal: triggered=True; proposed effect=**WATCH_SENSITIVITY_ONLY**

- Recommended spec: Use non-dominance on the frozen delayed-premium/historical-utility frontier as the primary delayed-premium promotion criterion; keep the absolute 60/65/70/75 thresholds as WATCH sensitivity rows; retain a same-path DCA18-relative premium guard to catch genuine over-eagerness.
- This is a governance proposal, not a production change. It records that the incumbent survives by non-dominance: no tested candidate lowers delayed-premium while preserving historical utility.

## Promotion Rule

A future policy may be labelled fully promoted only if both the current historical utility audit and the common-exam gates pass. Until then, dashboard PASS labels must be scoped as current utility audit only.

## Re-Entry Candidates

- `decoupled_deep_anchor` (TESTED_REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES): Test an anchor partly tied to realized valuation support or prior-cycle support rather than only the current bottom forecast multiplier.
- `delayed_release_reserve` (TESTED_REJECTED_HISTORICAL_UTILITY): Keep a larger late reserve until capitulation, time exhaustion, or recovery above a predeclared markup confirms.
- `anti_false_bottom_unlock` (TESTED_REJECTED_HISTORICAL_UTILITY): Limit catch-up and redeploy releases after shallow bounces unless final-low risk has materially decayed.
- `posterior_target_governor` (TESTED_REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES): Govern the posterior codex_target ramp before final-low risk has decayed, after first-decline attribution showed it drives the remaining synthetic premium.
