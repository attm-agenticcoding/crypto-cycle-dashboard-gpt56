# Robust Evaluation

Generated: 2026-07-07T02:21:56.438466+00:00
Verdict: **WATCH_CURRENT_UTILITY_AUDIT**

Reasons:
- bottom calibration MAE 0.20 > 0.18

Boundary:
- This verdict covers the historical utility audit, replay/jitter/target perturbation checks, leave-one-episode-out, and chronological holdout shown below.
- The stricter common exam is computed separately in `reports/common_exam_audit.md` and is not part of this scoped utility verdict.
- Fable's 2026-07-05 external core-only port found real LOCO merit but failed plateau and synthetic-stress checks; use the common exam below as the dashboard full-stack promotion gate.

## Common Exam

- Status: **PASS_FRONTIER_SCOPED**
- parameter_plateau_25pct: PASS_BY_RATCHET (cells=11, failing=4, worst shift=10.0%, materiality=DELTA_ONLY_REVIEW, delta-only=4)
- synthetic_delayed_lower_low: PASS_BY_NON_DOMINANCE (paths=1, failing=1, min DCA18 ratio=1.287973)
- synthetic_false_bottom_continued_grind: PASS_BY_RATCHET (paths=1, failing=1, min DCA18 ratio=1.429945)
- synthetic_fast_v_participation: PASS (paths=1, failing=0, min DCA18 ratio=1.033405)
- synthetic_shallow_recover: PASS (paths=1, failing=0, min DCA18 ratio=0.844307)
- early_exhaustion_guard: PASS (historical flags=0, synthetic flags=0)

## Cap Rationale Audit

- Status: **REVIEW_REQUIRED**
- Caps classified: 38; standard metrics: 6; non-canonical thresholds: 38; review-required: 25; implementation-review: 0
- Source mix: canonical metrics=0, nominal statistical targets=2, baseline-relative gates=11, policy risk tolerances=4, heuristic stress gates=21
- Interpretation: Most metrics used here are standard diagnostics, but the explicit numeric caps are local governance thresholds unless marked as nominal statistical targets. A triggered local cap should be read as WATCH/REVIEW evidence, not as proof that the model violated a universal market-standard constant.

## Policy Objective

- Version: policy-utility-v1
- Purpose: Judge policy changes by causal capital-deployment outcomes, not by bottom/top forecast aesthetics.

### Decoupled Deep-Anchor Candidate

- Verdict: **REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES**
- Best recipe: `library_p75_blend_50` (synthetic gates pass=False, historical utility preserved=True)
- Best synthetic status: **FAIL**; historical terminal win-rate 62%, worst terminal delta -3.7%, new early-exhaustion episodes 0
- The decoupled-deep-anchor sweep tests whether replacing the fixed forecast multiplier with asset-library support can solve the open synthetic gates without touching release mechanics. A rejected result means the remaining failure is not explained by the deep anchor alone; the evidence should be used before proposing a broader production policy change.

| Recipe | Verdict | Synthetic gap | Delayed avg/low | False-bottom 4w unlock | Hist win | Worst hist delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| library_median_blend_50 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -5.8% |
| library_p75_blend_50 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -3.7% |
| library_max_blend_35 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -6.8% |
| library_max_blend_50 | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.159564 | 73.4% | 22.6% | 62% | -7.6% |

### Release-Hardening Candidate

- Research-only causal overlay: throttles early front-loading by realized depth, caps the four-week unlock, and holds a late reserve until a non-forecast trigger (fast crash, deep capitulation, final third, or resolution) fires.
- Verdict: **REJECTED_HISTORICAL_UTILITY** (synthetic gates pass=True, historical utility preserved=False)
- Synthetic common-exam gates: **PASS**
- Historical vs live: terminal win-rate 38%, worst terminal delta -25.2%, mean terminal delta -6.0%, cost-premium win-rate 38%, new early-exhaustion episodes 0

| Synthetic path | Candidate metric | Value | Gate |
|---|---|---:|---|
| delayed_lower_low | avg entry premium to low | 54.5% | <= 60% |
| false_bottom_continued_grind | max four-week unlock | 15.7% | <= 20% |
| fast_v | deployed by fast-V low | 44.4% | >= 30% |
| shallow_recover | terminal vs DCA52 | 98.1% | >= 95% |

| Asset | Episode | Live terminal | Cand terminal | Terminal delta | Live avg/low | Cand avg/low | Premium delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BTC | 2018 bear (single low) | 1.296 | 0.970 | -25.2% | 73.4% | 131.8% | 58.3% |
| ETH | 2018 bear (single low) | 0.566 | 0.442 | -21.8% | 166.7% | 241.1% | 74.4% |
| BTC | 2022 bear (DOUBLE bottom) | 1.827 | 1.725 | -5.5% | 39.5% | 47.7% | 8.2% |
| ETH | 2022 bear (DOUBLE bottom) | 1.607 | 1.475 | -8.2% | 35.1% | 47.2% | 12.1% |
| BTC | 2019 H2 correction (mid-cycle) | 1.131 | 1.195 | 5.7% | 16.6% | 7.0% | -9.6% |
| ETH | 2019 H2 correction (mid-cycle) | 1.336 | 1.390 | 4.0% | 44.9% | 37.3% | -7.6% |
| BTC | 2020 COVID crash (fast V) | 1.480 | 1.443 | -2.5% | 25.9% | 29.3% | 3.4% |
| ETH | 2020 COVID crash (fast V) | 1.849 | 1.952 | 5.5% | 33.5% | 26.0% | -7.5% |

- The release-hardening overlay clears the delayed-lower-low average entry premium and false-bottom four-week unlock synthetic gates by throttling early front-loading and holding a late reserve until a non-forecast trigger fires. On the real accumulation episodes the same deferral buys later and higher in prolonged deep bears (2018 BTC/ETH worst), so terminal value and average cost both deteriorate versus live. Under the pre-registered promotion rule (historical utility AND common exam) the candidate is not promotable; it is recorded as a REJECTED research candidate with an explicit trade-off, not a production change.

### Posterior Target Governor Candidate

- Verdict: **REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES**
- Best recipe: `zero_posterior_lower_bound` (synthetic gates pass=False, historical utility preserved=False)
- Best synthetic status: **FAIL**; historical terminal win-rate 25%, worst terminal delta -14.3%, new early-exhaustion episodes 0
- The posterior-target governor tests the mechanism identified by first-decline attribution. The zero-posterior lower bound improves the open synthetic paths but still leaves delayed-lower-low average entry premium above the 60% gate, so model_target governance alone is insufficient; the remaining failure also involves the duration-CDF/depth-floor path.

| Recipe | Verdict | Synthetic gap | Delayed avg/low | False-bottom 4w unlock | Fast-V DCA18 | Hist win | Worst hist delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| rate_limited_fast_bypass | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.125445 | 72.5% | 16.0% | 94.7% | 62% | -7.3% |
| zero_posterior_lower_bound | REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES | 0.063994 | 66.4% | 8.3% | 91.2% | 25% | -14.3% |

### First-Decline-Leg Buy Attribution (research diagnostic)

- Attributes every live-policy buy on the two failing synthetic paths to its deployment mechanism, so the next candidate targets the real driver.

**delayed_lower_low** (low=32.0 at week 56, avg entry premium 73.4%, dominant premium source: `model_target_base`)

| Source | Spent | Avg price | Premium to low | Premium $ contrib | Pre-low | Post-low |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

- Max four-week unlock 21.5% at weeks 5-8 from: model_target_base 21.5%, price_improvement_catchup 0.0%

**false_bottom_continued_grind** (low=25.0 at week 76, avg entry premium 110.6%, dominant premium source: `model_target_base`)

| Source | Spent | Avg price | Premium to low | Premium $ contrib | Pre-low | Post-low |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

- Max four-week unlock 22.6% at weeks 7-10 from: model_target_base 22.6%

- On both open synthetic failures the model_target (posterior) schedule is the dominant dollar-premium source: it front-loads the working bucket during the first decline leg at the highest pre-low prices (avg premium +124% delayed / +211% false-bottom), while the duration-CDF depth floor and post-low redeploy buy far cheaper. The max four-week unlock is likewise a first-decline-leg working-bucket ramp. This means the deep anchor and the reserve/release mechanics are not the primary levers for these two gates; a future candidate should govern how fast the posterior target itself deploys before final-low risk has decayed.

### Delayed-Premium Gate Attainability (cross-round synthesis)

- Gate: delayed-lower-low avg entry premium <= 60%; attainable without historical-utility loss: **False**; review status: **THRESHOLD_REVIEW_REQUIRED**
- Minimum threshold for any tested lever: 54.5%; for a utility-preserving tested lever: 73.4%

| Lever | Delayed avg premium | Gate pass | Historical utility preserved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| live_policy | 73.4% | False | True |
| posterior_target_zero_lower_bound | 66.4% | False | False |
| release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | 54.5% | True | False |

| Review threshold | Passing levers | Utility-preserving passing levers | Interpretation |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 60% | release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | none | only_non_utility_preserving_or_unscored_levers_pass |
| 65% | release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | none | only_non_utility_preserving_or_unscored_levers_pass |
| 70% | posterior_target_zero_lower_bound, release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | none | only_non_utility_preserving_or_unscored_levers_pass |
| 75% | live_policy, posterior_target_zero_lower_bound, release_hardening_target_and_depth_floor_throttle | live_policy | at_least_one_utility_preserving_tested_lever_passes |

### Cost Of Relaxation

| Option | Delayed avg premium | Premium reduction vs live | Historical cost to accept |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Keep current gate/blocker and live policy | 73.4% | 0.0% | none (status quo); current utility terminal win-rate vs median baseline 88% |
| Accept target-zero lower bound behavior | 66.4% | 7.0% | historical utility not preserved; verdict REJECTED_SYNTHETIC_GATES; terminal win-rate vs live 25%; worst terminal delta -14.3%; cost win-rate vs live 38%; worst cost-premium delta 19.6% |
| Accept release-hardening throttle behavior | 54.5% | 18.8% | historical utility not preserved; verdict REJECTED_HISTORICAL_UTILITY; terminal win-rate vs live 38%; worst terminal delta -25.2%; cost win-rate vs live 38%; worst cost-premium delta 74.4% |

- Across every tested lever the delayed-lower-low average entry premium gate (<= 60%) is reachable only by throttling first-decline depth-floor deployment (the release-hardening lever), which the historical-utility audit rejects on prolonged 2018-style bears. Governing the posterior target alone floors at roughly 66% because the duration-CDF depth floor independently deploys the working bucket at first-decline prices. No tested lever reaches the gate while preserving historical utility, so within the current policy architecture this gate appears unattainable without historical-utility loss. Per the governance point, the next round should either accept this as the documented trade-off of record, or review whether the 60% threshold is attainable and correctly specified, keeping the current value as a sensitivity row and justifying any change with this frontier rather than tuning to pass.

### Frontier-Aware Gate Proposal (research-only)

- Status: **PROPOSED_FRONTIER_AWARE_PASS**; proposed delayed-premium verdict: **PASS_BY_NON_DOMINANCE**; production policy change: **False**
- Non-dominance: incumbent `live_policy` non-dominated=**True**; dominating levers: none
- Relative premium guard vs `fixed_18w_dca_same_synthetic_path`: policy 73.4%; baseline 123.8%; policy/baseline 59.3%; status **PASS**
- Absolute 60% gate under this proposal: triggered=True; proposed effect=**WATCH_SENSITIVITY_ONLY**

- Recommended spec: Use non-dominance on the frozen delayed-premium/historical-utility frontier as the primary delayed-premium promotion criterion; keep the absolute 60/65/70/75 thresholds as WATCH sensitivity rows; retain a same-path DCA18-relative premium guard to catch genuine over-eagerness.
- This is a governance proposal, not a production change. It records that the incumbent survives by non-dominance: no tested candidate lowers delayed-premium while preserving historical utility.
